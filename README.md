# Open Funding

We're building an open platform for running CLR / quadratic funding pilots, as discussed in [this Ethereum Magicians thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/identity-and-quadratic-funding-standards-to-help-fund-projects-and-commons/3835/5) and [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/paulcowgill/status/1203759229359853568).

This project is open-source and in need of additional funding to sustain work on it. If you're able to contribute, please consider [supporting the project on Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/230/open-funding) or sending ETH, SAI, or DAI to the Open Funding project's contract address:

`0xb2e7e101b8248021be72e76890ea24cfad967aec` ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2e7e101b8248021be72e76890ea24cfad967aec))

CRL / quadratic funding put as simply as possible:

**small contributions from lots of people get "bonus points"**

The aim is to productize Gitcoin Grants and let people use it more generally for different types of projects other than open source / Ethereum-related media and with different assumptions around identity / login that don't rely on GitHub.

*Note: If this project doesn't get the equivalent of 5,000 in DAI/SAI during Gitcoin Grants CLR Round 4, we'll refund people's contributions (minus transaction costs).*

Eventually the contributors to this project would like to work with other teams on developing an EIP / standard, but it's too early for that now - more direct experimentation is needed.
